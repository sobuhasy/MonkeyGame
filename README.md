Welcome to MonkeyGame, a fun and engaging JavaScript game inspired by the classic Space Invaders and from a tutorial I found on YouTube (in German: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGlJsgdgHuw).

## Game Overview
In MonkeyGame, you play as a zookeeper in a lively jungle full of hungry monkeys and gorillas. Your mission? Feed them with bananas!

The gameplay is simple yet addictive:

1. **Move the Zookeeper**: Use your keyboard arrows to move the zookeeper left or right at the bottom of the screen.
2. **Throw Bananas**: Press the spacebar to throw bananas at the monkeys and gorillas.
